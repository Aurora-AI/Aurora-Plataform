# MIT Westerman Integration 360º Report

Date: 2025-08-15
Author: Agent Curador (Automated)

## Objective
Confirm the integration of the MIT transformation doctrine into the Aurora Codex and provide recommendations to operationalize the principle across product, architecture and culture.

## Status
- `docs/CODICE_AURORA.md` updated to include the "Filosofia da Transformação (Princípio do MIT)" in PARTE I.
- New study added at `docs/library/mit_westerman_transformation_strategy.md`.

## Risks and Opportunities
- Opportunity: Aligns the organization on outcome-first development and provides a clear rubric for prioritizing experiments and MVPs.
- Risk: Requires discipline on metrics and may slow down purely technical experimentation; mitigate with light-weight experiment templates and fast rollback.

## Operational recommendations (next 90 days)
1. Add `experiment_template.md` and `transformation_kpi_catalog.md` to `/docs/checklists/` and require them for any new OS submissions. (Effort: Low)
2. Instrument pipelines and agents to emit KPI signals for product experiments (e.g., ingestion latency, precision, user satisfaction proxies). (Effort: Medium)
3. Run a 6-week “transformation apprenticeship” across 2 pilot teams to adopt the measurement-first playbook. (Effort: Medium)
4. Make the Codex change visible in onboarding and engineering rituals — add to the weekly guild meetings and PR templates. (Effort: Low)

## Compliance & Traceability
- Changes committed on branch `feature/tce-rn-connector` at 2025-08-15. Ensure PR references this report and the OS AUR-KGM-010.

## Acceptance
- The Codex now contains the MIT transformation principle and the study file; this report confirms initial integration. Further operationalization tasks are recommended above.
